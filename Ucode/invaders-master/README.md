# Space Invaders Clone

**This is an artifact of my early programming career and is the first game that I ever made (circa 2005). Please have mercy on me for any sloppiness or dumb errors in the code.**

This game was written in C using the Ncurses library, and it's played entirely within the shell with ASCII graphics.

The original description that I wrote for this game:

*This program is modeled after the 80's arcade classic Space Invaders. A "tank" moves across
the bottom of the screen and shoots at "aliens" that move across and down the screen while
dropping bombs. The game is lost if the tank is hit by a bomb or an alien reaches
the bottom of the screen. The game is won by shooting down all of the aliens. This game
also features a menu which allows the user to adjust the overall speed of the game as well
as the relative speeds of the individual elements.*
